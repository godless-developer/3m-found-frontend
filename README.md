# Admin Dashboard - Company Employee Management

## Overview

This project is part of a larger system consisting of three main parts:

1. **Extension Project** – Client-facing extension.
2. **Web Front Project (This Repository)** – Admin Dashboard for managing company employees.
3. **Backend Project** – API and database management.

The goal of this project is to provide an **Admin Dashboard** where administrators can manage all employee-related information, monitor statuses, view graphical reports, and handle onboarding processes. It is built with **Next.js** and styled with **Ant Design (antd)**, and deployed on **Vercel**.

Additional integrations include AI-powered tools (e.g., [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)) for enhanced features such as employee data handling, feedback collection, and advanced analytics. More features may be added over time.
